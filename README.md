# Mode7
This is my implementation of mode 7(pseudo 3d floor) that was made by Nintendo
I made this in 5 days for LowRezJam 2022, but couldn't finish the jam, so I uploaded only thisüòÅ
Everything is written in Python and pygame, it's pretty unoptimized, it runs at 90 fps on (64, 64) resolution
Maybe when I learn C I will optimize itü§´

Here is the demo!
